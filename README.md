# My-First-Repository

This is my first repository.

It contains several folders with assets.

. Folder ‘images’ contains jpeg, bmp, and so on files that I need for my
documents. . Folder ‘plots’ contains images that I generate through
code, possibly for publisher.

The function ‘print’ will display the argument on the screen.

``` r
print("Hello, World!")
#> [1] "Hello, World!"
```

# what is your main research interest

My primary research interest lies in **bioinformatics**, specifically
the integration of **machine learning** techniques in analyzing
large-scale **genomic and microbiome data**. I am fascinated by how
computational tools can help unravel complex biological processes,
leading to the discovery of novel therapeutic targets. The
interdisciplinary nature of this field allows me to merge my passion for
biology and programming, and I aim to contribute towards advancing
personalized medicine.
